## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.links path:hover {
  fill: var(--white);
  cursor: pointer;
}
```
First time changing fill color on an svg, which I did not know you could do.

### Continued development

Utilizing transitions and animations in css. Toggling events through JS as well.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks - fill](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/f/fill/) - This helped me for figuring out how to change fill property on an svg.
